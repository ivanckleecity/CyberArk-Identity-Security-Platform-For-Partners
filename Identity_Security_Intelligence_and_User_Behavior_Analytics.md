# Identity Security Intelligence
 - Identity Security Intelligence (ISI) is an artificial intelligence (AI) powered, SaaS-based service that analyzes data collected from various sources and identifies patterns in order to detect threats and high-risk activities for identities such as workforce, privileged, and external vendors.
   - ISI provides deep insight into high-risk events and automated risk remediation using:
   - Dashboards to visualize data and identify trends
   - Reporting tools to investigate security incidents and support audits
   - Alerts to notify administrators of suspicious events in real-time
   - Webhooks to interface with external ticket and help-desk tools
   - These tools enable Security teams to both investigate and respond to targeted threats with the appropriate actions.
   - ISI detects and creates alerts for User Behavior Analytics (UBA) events and Privileged Detection events.
