## What is Secrets Hub?
Secrets Hub is a CyberArk SaaS solution that addresses the challenge of managing multiple security platforms in the cloud.

## Industry challenge: Lack of centralized secret management
In many enterprises today, a high proportion of user name and password credentials are not managed centrally, but are managed in security islands. As a result, security admin users do not have one place to control and manage all enterprise secrets. It's also difficult, if not impossible, for security admin to enforce a unified security standard across the organization.

Another obstacle to centralized secret management is that application owners developers prefer to work natively, without having to manage security and password rotation.

## Solution: Securing cloud secrets with Secrets Hub
Secrets Hub is a CyberArk SaaS solution that facilitates centralized control of secrets in one place.

Secrets Hub acts as a trusted connector between cloud applications that run on cloud platforms (AWS or Microsoft Azure) and CyberArk Privilege Cloud. The secrets managed separately by multiple cloud platform applications are securely integrated with CyberArk Privilege Cloud. This integration enables your enterprise to securely manage its cloud secrets and enforce security policies on those secrets. As a unified centralized hub, Secrets Hub manages your enterprise secrets without affecting developer velocity
