# Policies
## Step-up authentication by using DUO OTP
 - You can force users to provide additional credentials before they can launch applications or run applications with elevated privileges, using any identity provider that supports the OpenID Connect protocol. Endpoint users can specify these credentials in the Application Launch Alert, Elevate, and Elevate Trusted dialogs that are configured for policies with Elevate and Elevate if necessary actions
